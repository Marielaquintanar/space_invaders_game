# Space Invaders Game

## Project Description

The Space Invaders Game is a classic arcade-style shooting game where players control a spaceship and must defend Earth from invading alien forces. 
In this project, I've created a Space Invaders game using Python and the Pygame library. Players can move their spaceship left and right, 
shoot bullets to destroy the incoming alien invaders, and earn points for each successful hit. 
The game becomes progressively challenging as more aliens descend, making it a thrilling and nostalgic gaming experience.

### Key Features

- Fire bullets to destroy approaching alien invaders.
- Earn points for each alien successfully defeated.
- Progressively increasing difficulty as more aliens appear.
- Classic arcade-style gameplay for a nostalgic experience.
